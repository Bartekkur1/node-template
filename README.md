# Node Project Template

This repository contains basic starting point of a new node projects, I have no idea why I didnt create one before its pretty neat time saver. It comes preinstalled with few basic packages that will help (mainly me) start with my projects and skip the whole setup time waste.

## Key Features

1. TypeScript - I mean... no introduction needed here, no brainer
2. UUID - Don't remember when was the last time I did not use it my project, nice random ID is pretty nice right
3. Testing (Jest + Sinon) - We are adults here, imagine creating something without tests, yeah, goodluck. These are my baisc go to packages for writing tests.
4. Eslint - with presetuped basic airbnb rules. You know, to pretend code quality.
5. Basic scripts to run tests and app - yeah, "time saver" took me like 0.04 seconds to create them, but hey, calculating that I have a new idea every 30 seconds thats like a 2 hours saved per year.

## To Do

- [ ] Probably docker file would be nice, we'll see.
- [x] Configuration... cannot believe I forgot this one.
- [x] Logger (facepalm)
